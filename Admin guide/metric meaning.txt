- Dbtime: sum of all Elapsed time of all process in dbtime
- Clock Time : realtime
- AAS: Dbtime/Clock Time


If AAS ~ 0 then the database is idle.
If AAS < 1 the database is fine
If AAS << # of CPUs the database is fine
If AAS ~ # of CPUs there might be performance problems
If AAS > # of CPUs there is definitely a performance problem.
