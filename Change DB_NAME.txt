Change the database DB_NAME with NID
http://www.online-database.eu/index.php/backup-a-recovery/58-nid-change-dbname 

Whereras changing the DBID with nid has a non reversable impact on your backup and recovery possibilities, changing only the database DB_NAME has significantly less consequences since,

1. it does not invalidate previously taken backups

2. it does not invalidate previously generated archivelogs

3. it does not require opening the database with the resetlogs option.

 

Let us change the database db_name without changing the database dbid, nevertheless you shuld be aware of the impact as well.
