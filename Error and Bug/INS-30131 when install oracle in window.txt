The error code is [INS-30131]. I've the full privileges of an administrator-ship. I also tried to resolve this problem via the following command;

net use \\localhost\c$
------------------------------

For a client installation:

-ignorePrereq -J"-Doracle.install.client.validate.clientSupportedOSCheck=false"
For a server installation:

-ignorePrereq -J"-Doracle.install.db.validate.supportedOSCheck=false"


----------------------------------

setup.exe -ignorePrereq -J"-Doracle.install.client.validate.clientSupportedOSCheck=false"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I found another situation in which this problem may arise (despite following the steps listed by other users above) and that's when the username of the user you're logged in as has an '_' on it. The path it will try to use to find the temp directory is whatever is set in %TEMP%. I managed to work around it by:

Launch cmd.exe in Administrator mode
SET TEMP = C:\TEMP
Run the installer from that command window
Installed successfully that way.
