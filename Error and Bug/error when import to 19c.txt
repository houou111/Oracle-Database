CHANGES
 

CAUSE
The errors are caused by the fact that a previous DataPump import job exited ungracefully, without cleaning up DST_UPGRADE_STATE due to secondary timezone table.
The errors could be also introduced after multiple import jobs were running and changed the data in the secondary timezone table.

This can be checked with the following query:

connect / as sysdba

SELECT PROPERTY_NAME, SUBSTR (property_value, 1, 30) value
FROM   DATABASE_PROPERTIES
WHERE  PROPERTY_NAME LIKE 'DST_%'
ORDER  BY PROPERTY_NAME;

PROPERTY_NAME              VALUE
-------------------------- -------------------------------
DST_PRIMARY_TT_VERSION     11
DST_SECONDARY_TT_VERSION   3
DST_UPGRADE_STATE          DATAPUMP(1)

Above query shows the row having DATAPUMP(<x>) value where <x> is a number equal or greater than 1 for DST_UPGRADE_STATE property.

This problem is addressed in unpublished
Bug 11836540 - ABORTED DATA PUMP DID NOT CLEAN UP DST_UPGRADE_STATE

The bug is fixed in 12.2.

SOLUTION
To solve the issue, use any of below alternatives:

Upgrade to 12.2 when available

- OR -

Apply interim Patch 11836540, if available for your platform and Oracle version.

To check for conflicting patches, please use the MOS Patch Planner Tool
Please refer to
Note 1317012.1 - How To Use MOS Patch Planner To Check And Request The Conflict Patches?

If no patch exists for your version, please contact Oracle Support for a backport request.

- OR -

Use next workaround:
connect / as sysdba
ALTER SESSION SET EVENTS '30090 TRACE NAME CONTEXT FOREVER, LEVEL 32';
exec dbms_dst.unload_secondary;

Then re-check the new value for DST_UPGRADE_STATE property. This should return "NONE". If the value for DATAPUMP was > 1 (for example DATAPUMP(2) or DATAPUMP(3) ) then it might be needed to call dbms_dst.unload_secondary several times until the return value will be "NONE".
After that, restart the import.
