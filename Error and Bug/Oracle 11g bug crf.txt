Oracle Cluster Health Monitor (CHM) using large amount of space (more than default) (Doc ID 1343105.1)

cd /u01/app/11.2.0/grid/crf/db/dc-ora-db01/

rm -rf *.bdb

One reason for the large bdb files is that the retention period is large.   Issue "GI_HOME/bin/oclumon.pl" to get the current value of the retention period  that is given in seconds.  Issue "oclumon manage -repos resize <desired value in seconds>" to change the retention period.  One example is "oclumon manage -repos resize 259200" that retains the CHM data for 3 days (259200 seconds is the number of seconds in 3 days)
