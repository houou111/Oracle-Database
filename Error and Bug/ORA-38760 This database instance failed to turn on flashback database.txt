SQL> shutdown immediate;
SQL> startup mount;
SQL> alter database flashback off;
SQL> alter database backup controlfile to trace noresetlogs;
SQL> shutdown immediate;
 
 
go to the trace file generated after executing (alter database backup controlfile to trace noresetlogs;)
 
trace file location can be found from the query:
 
SQL>select * from v$diag_info;
 
 
it will contain script with SQL Commands, you can rename the trace file with ".sql" extension.
 
 
SQL> startup nomount
SQL>@trace_file.sql
SQL> recover database;
SQL> alter database open;
 
**** so basically you are going to re-create the control files again....
