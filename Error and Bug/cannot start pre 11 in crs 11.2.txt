Solution:

1. To start a pre11gR2 database in 11gR2 Grid Infrastructure environment, node(s) must be pinned. To pin node(s), as root execute:

$GRID_HOME/bin/crsctl pin css -n <racnode1> <racnode2> <racnode3>
To find out whether node(s) is pinned or not:

$GRID_HOME/bin/olsnodes -t -n


2. patch 8288490 and 8262786
