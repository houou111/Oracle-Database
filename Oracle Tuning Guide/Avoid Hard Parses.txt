In an OLTP system, reduce misses by keeping hard-parsing to a minimum:
• Make sure that users can share statements.
• Prevent frequently used statements from being aged out by allocating enough space.
• Avoid invalidations that induce reparsing.



If % Pct Miss is greater than 10% in an OLTP system:
– Improve the sharing of your application code by using bind variables
– Increase the size of the shared pool
– Set the CURSOR_SHARING parameter
