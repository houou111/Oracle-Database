db filesequential read


- The Oracle process wants a block that is currently not in the SGA, and it is waiting for the database block to be read into the SGA from disk.
- The two important numbers to look for are the TIME_WAITED and AVERAGE_WAIT by individual sessions.
- Significant db file sequential read wait time is most likely an application issue.
