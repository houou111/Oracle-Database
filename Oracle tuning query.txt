Here is the list of the top 20 SQL query optimization techniques I found important:

1. Create an index on very large tables (>1.000.000) rows

2. Use EXIST() instead of COUNT() to find an element in the table

3. SELECT fields instead of using SELECT *

4. Avoid Subqueries in WHERE Clause

5. Avoid SELECT DISTINCT where possible

6. Use WHERE Clause instead of HAVING

7. Create joins with INNER JOIN (not WHERE)

8. Use LIMIT to sample query results

9. Use UNION ALL instead of UNION wherever possible

10. Use UNION where instead of WHERE ... or ... query.

11. Run your query during off-peak hours

12. Avoid using OR in join queries

14. Choose GROUP BY over window functions

15. Use derived and temporary tables

16. Drop the index before loading bulk data

16. Use materialized views instead of views

17. Avoid != or <> (not equal) operator

18. Minimize the number of subqueries

19. Try to use INNER join as little as possible when you can get the same output using LEFT/RIGHT join.

20. For retrieving the same dataset frequently try to use temporary sources.
