--------Concept----------
ALWAYS - All LOBs in ASSM tablespaces are created as SecureFile LOBs. LOBs in non-ASSM tablespaces are created as BasicFile LOBs unless explicitly specified as SecureFiles. BasicFile storage options are ignored, and SecureFile default storage options are used for any unspecified options.
FORCE - All LOBs are created as SecureFile LOBs. If the LOB is being created in a non-ASSM tablespace, an error is thrown. BasicFile storage options are ignored, and SecureFile default storage options are used for any unspecified options.
PERMITTED - The default setting, which allows SecureFile LOB storage when the SECUREFILE keyword is used. The default storage method is BASICFILE.
NEVER - Creation of SecureFile LOBs is not permitted.
IGNORE - Prevent creation of SecureFile LOBs, and ignore any errors associated with SecureFile storage options.
The parameter is dynamic, so it can be set using the ALTER SYSTEM command.

SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET db_securefile = 'FORCE';
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET db_securefile = 'IGNORE';
