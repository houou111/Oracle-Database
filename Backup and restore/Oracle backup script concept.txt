1. Backup option
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%a	Specifies the activation ID of the database
%c	Specifies the copy number of the backup piece within a set of duplexed backup pieces. If you did not duplex a backup, then this variable is 1 for backup sets and 0 for proxy copies. If one of these commands is enabled, then the variable shows the copy number. The maximum value for %c is 256.
%d	Specifies the name of the database
%D	Specifies the current day of the month from the Gregorian calendar in format DD
%e	Specifies the archived log sequence number
%f	Specifies the absolute file number
%F	Combines the DBID, day, month, year, and sequence into a unique and repeatable generated name. This variable translates into c-IIIIIIIIII-YYYYMMDD-QQ, where: IIIIIIIIII stands for the DBID. The DBID is printed in decimal so that it can be easily associated with the target database. YYYYMMDD is a time stamp in the Gregorian calendar of the day the backup is generated. QQ is the sequence in hexadecimal number that starts with 00 and has a maximum of FF (256).
%h	Specifies the archived redo log thread number
%I	Specifies the DBID
%M	Specifies the month in the Gregorian calendar in format MM
%N	Specifies the tablespace name
%n	Specifies the name of the database, padded on the right with x characters to a total length of eight characters. For example, if the prod1 is the database name, then the padded name is prod1xxx.
%p	Specifies the piece number within the backup set. This value starts at 1 for each backup set and is incremented by 1 as each backup piece is created.
%s	Specifies the backup set number. This number is a counter in the control file that is incremented for each backup set. The counter value starts at 1 and is unique for the lifetime of the control file. If you restore a backup control file, then duplicate values can result. Also, created controlfile initializes the counter back to 1.
%t	Specifies the backup set time stamp, which is a 4-byte value derived as the number of seconds elapsed since a fixed reference time. The combination of %s and %t can be used to form a unique name for the backup set.
%T	Specifies the year, month and day in the Gregorian calendar in this format: YYYYMMDD
%u	Specifies an 8-character name constituted by compressed representations of the backup set or image copy number and the time the backup set or image copy was created.
%U	Specifies a system-generated unique filename (default). The meaning of %U  is different for image copies and backup pieces.
%Y	Specifies the year in the format YYYY
