Transaction Guard (new in 12.2) -> protect the transactions
• After outages, users know what happened to their in-flight
transactions, such as fund transfers, flight bookings, and
bill payments.
• Transaction Guard provides better performance and
reliability than home-built code for idempotence.


Server configuration:
– Set the COMMIT_OUTCOME=TRUE service attribute
– Optionally, set the RETENTION_TIMEOUT service attribute
