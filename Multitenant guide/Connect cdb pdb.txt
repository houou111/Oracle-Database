I. Check all db and service
-----------------------------------------------------
SELECT CDB FROM V$DATABASE;


col name for a30
col pdb for a30

select name, pdb
from   v$services
order by name;

col name format a30
select con_id, name, open_mode from v$containers;



SHOW CON_NAME
SHOW CON_ID
show pdbs
select con_id, name, open_mode, total_size from v$pdbs;


II. Connect to cdb, pdb
-----------------------------------------------------
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=HTKD;
SHOW CON_NAME


ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=cdb$root;
SHOW CON_NAME


SQL> -- EZCONNECT
SQL> CONN system/password@//localhost:1521/pdb1
Connected.
SQL>

SQL> -- tnsnames.ora
SQL> CONN system/password@pdb1
Connected.
SQL>

 
 
III. Open/Close PDB
-----------------------------------------------------
 
SQL> alter pluggable database open [close];

SQL> alter pluggable database PDB02 open read only [restrict];

SQL> alter pluggable database 

SQL> alter pluggable database all [except PDB02] open;

SQL> alter pluggable database open instances = ('CDB011','CDB012');
SQL> alter pluggable database open instances = all [except ('CDB014');
SQL> alter pluggable database close relocate to CDB014;
It is also possible to put the pluggable database in the desired state, and whenever the CDB is opened, the PDB is opened in that state. But remember that it is a per-instance operation, so you will have to do that in every instance in case of a RAC database.

SQL> alter pluggable database PDB02 save state;


 
III. Alter parameter
-----------------------------------------------------
ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINER=HTKD;
alter system set
