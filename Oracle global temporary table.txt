ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS

as the syntax shows rows only exist in the table prior to the commit statement. In other words whenever you pass a commit statement all the rows in the table will be deleted.

when you query the table before commit you will find data in it. Kindly update the procedure to get the data before commit and put that data into a permanent table and then you can check that permanent table later.
in case permanent table insertion is not the option, you can only select that data and get the output before commit and you would find that data.

But once you pass the commit statement no data will be found in the table.

Thanks
