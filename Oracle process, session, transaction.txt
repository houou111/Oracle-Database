1. Concept
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A session is created when a user connects to the database and is terminated when the user disconnects. 
Each session is assigned a unique identifier called a session ID (SID), which is used to identify the session in various system views and tables. 
A session can execute one or more SQL statements, and it can have access to different resources and privileges based on the user's permissions.


A process is a task that runs in the background and performs various activities to manage the database instance. 
Each process has a specific role, and it performs a particular function, such as managing the shared pool, writing data to disk, or handling network connections.
Processes are created by the Oracle instance to manage various tasks, and they can be viewed using operating system utilities such as Task Manager or ps command. 
Some of the important processes in Oracle include:
- Oracle background processes (e.g., DBWn, LGWR, PMON, etc.)
- User processes (i.e., sessions)
- Operating system processes (e.g., Oracle Agent, Listener, etc.)


2. Recipe
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
processes=x

session=(1.5 * PROCESSES) + 22

transactions=sessions*1.1 


3. Check
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
select name, value
from v$spparameter
where name in ('sessions','processes','transactions');



select name, value
from v$parameter
where name in ('sessions','processes','transactions');
