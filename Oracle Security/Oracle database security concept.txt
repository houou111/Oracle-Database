Default Oracle Database features:
- User accounts. When you create user accounts, you can secure them in a variety of ways. 
You can also create password profiles to better secure password policies for your site.

- Authentication methods. Oracle Database provides several ways to configure authentication for users and database administrators. 
For example, you can authenticate users on the database level, from the operating system, and on the network. 

- Privileges and roles. You can use privileges and roles to restrict user access to data. 
The following chapters describe how to manage privileges and roles:
	Configuring Privilege and Role Authorization
	Performing Privilege Analysis to Find Privilege Use
	Managing Security for Definer's Rights and Invoker's Rights
	Managing Fine-Grained Access in PL/SQL Packages and Types
	Managing Security for a Multitenant Environment in Enterprise Manager
	
- Application security. The first step to creating a database application is to ensure that it is properly secure. 
Managing Security for Application Developers, discusses how to incorporate application security into your application security policies

- User session information using application context. An application context is a name-value pair that holds the session information. 
You can retrieve session information about a user, such as the user name or terminal, and restrict database and application access for that user based on this information. 
Using Application Contexts to Retrieve User Information, describes how to use application contexts.

- Database access on the row and column level using Virtual Private Database. 
A Virtual Private Database policy dynamically imbeds a WHERE predicate into SQL statements the user issues. 
Using Oracle Virtual Private Database to Control Data Access, describes how to create and manage Virtual Private Database policies.
