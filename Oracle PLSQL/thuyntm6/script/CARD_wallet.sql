the steps to create wallet. 
===================

Once the password file is copied to DR server, autologin file needs to be created with password.

####### Node 1

change password


Can I change the wallet password?
Yes, the wallet password can be changed with Oracle Wallet Manager (OWM). 
Create a backup before attempting to change the wallet password. Changing the wallet password does not change the encryption master key â€” they are independent. 
In Oracle 11gR1 11.1.0.7, orapki has been enhanced to allow wallet password changes from the command line:

 $ orapki wallet change_pwd -wallet <wallet_location>
 
 
 
 
 8.2.2.2 Resetting the Master Encryption Key
Reset/Regenerate the master encryption key only if it has been compromised or as per the security policies of the organization. You should back up the wallet before resetting the master encryption key.

Frequent master encryption key regeneration does not necessarily enhance system security. Security modules can store a large number of keys. However, this number is not unlimited. Frequent master encryption key regeneration can exhaust all available storage space.

To reset the master encryption key, use the SQL syntax as shown in "Setting the Master Encryption Key".

Note:

If you are resetting the master encryption key for a wallet that has auto login enabled, then you must ensure that both the auto login wallet, identified by the .sso file, and the encryption wallet, identified by the .p12 file, are present before issuing the command to reset the master encryption key.
The ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY command is a data definition language (DDL) command requiring the ALTER SYSTEM privilege, and it automatically commits any pending transactions. Example 8-1 shows a sample usage of this command.

Example 8-1 Setting or Resetting the Master Encryption Key To Use a PKI-Based Private Key

SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY "j23lm781098dhb345sm" IDENTIFIED BY "password";
Here, j23lm781098dhb345sm is the certificate ID and password is the wallet password.

For PKI-based keys, certificate revocation lists are not enforced as enforcing certificate revocation may lead to losing access to all encrypted information in the database. However, you cannot use the same certificate to create the master key again.
